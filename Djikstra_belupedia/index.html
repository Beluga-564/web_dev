        <p>
            <h4>
            Edsger Dijkstra, in full Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, (born May 11, 1930, Rotterdam, Netherlands—died August 6, 2002, Nuenen), Dutch computer scientist who developed the paradigm of structured programming for writing computer programs.

            Dijkstra received a Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam in 1959 while working at Amsterdam’s Mathematical Center (1952–62). He taught at the Technical University of Eindhoven from 1963 to 1973. He was a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation from 1973 to 1984 and a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 to 2000.

            <li><p><h2>Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam</h2>
                From 1952 until 1962, Dijkstra worked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_%26_Informatica" target="_blank">Mathematisch Centrum</a> in Amsterdam, where he worked closely with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Jan_Loopstra" target="_blank">Bram Jan Loopstra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carel_S._Scholten" target="_blank">Carel S. Scholten</a>, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.Dijkstra formulated and solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem" target="_blank">shortest path problem</a> for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956. Because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing, he did not publish the result until 1959.
                
                At the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague Jaap Zonneveld  developed the first compiler for the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60" target="_blank">ALGOL 60</a> by August 1960, more than a year before a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank">compiler</a> was produced by another group

                <h2>Eindhoven University of Technology</h2>
    
    The Eindhoven University of Technology, located in Eindhoven in the south of the Netherlands, where Dijkstra was a professor of mathematics from 1962 to 1984.
    In 1962, Dijkstra moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven" target="_blank">Eindhoven</a>, and later to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuenen" target="_blank">Nuenen</a>, in the south of the Netherlands, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven_University_of_Technology" target="_blank">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department. In the late 1960s he built the THE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THE_multiprogramming_system" target="_blank">operating system</a> (named for the university, then known as Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven), which has influenced the designs of subsequent operating systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory.

                    <h2>Burroughs Corporation</h2>
        Dijkstra joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_Corporation" target="_blank">Burroughs Corporation</a>, a company known then for producing computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its research fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the firm's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects: notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin (USA)</a>, a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin, Texas.
        
        The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.

        The University of Texas at Austin, where Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences from 1984 until 1999.
